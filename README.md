# DH2323_lab1_mac
My SDL2 template for the first laboratory exercise in the course "Computer graphics and interaction" (DH2323)

Do not forget to install SDL2 before attempting to compile the files. Also,
I changed the setup somewhat in order to be able to display the three exercises
at once without having to manipulate the code in between. So, the program starts with a white screen and press the keys _1_,_2_ and _3_ display the different exercises.
